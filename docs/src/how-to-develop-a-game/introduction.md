# Introduction

This section will guide you through the process of creating a very small stub for a game.

You will set up a quick game with a single location, a couple of interacting characters and items, plus dialogs and inventory.

You can use the resulting stub to experiment and tinker as you read the documentation. If you are already familiar with Popochiu and have already created your project, you can jump to the [Tutorials](../../../getting-started/tutorials) section to learn more about more advanced features.

!!! info
    If you are moving your first steps in Adventure Games development, or just evaluating if Popochiu is for you, you may want to download the [Example Game Assets [Pack](../../../getting-started/example-resources#example-assets), which contains all the assets used in this tutorial.

    If you just want to tinker with Popochiu or experiment on a throw-away project, you can just clone the [Example Game](../../../getting-started/example-resources#example-game), that's already complete and ready to run.
