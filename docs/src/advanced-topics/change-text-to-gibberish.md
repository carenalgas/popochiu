## Text-To-Gibberish Feature

In adventure games dialogs between characters is one of a main thing you don't want to spoiler for gamers. Thats why it would be cool to hide what characters are talking about when you streaming or showing someone part of a game.

That is why there is a text-to-gibberish feature that change all text and/or dialog options to gibberish only within game.

### Spoken text

To change all spoken text by characters to gibberish you need to change one option in **Project Settings -> Popochiu -> Dialogs** :  
![Spoken text to gibberish of](../../assets/images/how-to-develop-a-game/adv_tech_talk_gibberish_setting.png "Spoken text feature")
