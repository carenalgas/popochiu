![Popochiu - An adventure games plugin for Godot](./assets/images/_other/theme/home_banner.svg)

---

**Popochiu is the most developer-friendly addon for the creation of point-and-click adventure games in Godot.**

Inspired by [Adventure Game Studio](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) and [PowerQuest](https://powerhoof.itch.io/powerquest) Unity plugin, it brings a bunch of innovations to the table.

**Popochiu's mission is to be the more developer-oriented and productive tool for the creation of point-and-click adventure games on free and open-Source technologies.**

## Is Popochiu for me?

**Popochiu is for everyone, but it's particularly suitable for you if you**:

* are in search for a developer-friendly engine, with a powerful scripting language
* want to work on top of a state-of-the-art, general-purpose game engine with a great community and support (Godot)
* want to build your game on OS different than Windows (Linux or MacOSX)
* want to release your game on different platforms (PC, mobile and consoles)
* love Free/Open-Source Software
* want to join a cheerful and welcoming community of fellow developers

**Popochiu may not be your cup of tea if**:

* you are no coder and search for a visual editor like Adventure Creator
* you want to build games different from point-and-click adventures

Yes, that's it. We can't imagine for what other reasons you shouldn't at least give Popochiu a try! :)
