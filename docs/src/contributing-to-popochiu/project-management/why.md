# Why we care

We want Popochiu to be a high-quality FOSS project, much like Godot. We believe that alongside useful features and comprehensive documentation, a transparent and well-structured project management approach is essential to ensure its success.

By adopting a consistent workflow, doing our best to share our goals, and ensuring transparency in our processes, we aim to benefit both adopters and contributors. Adopters can better assess if Popochiu meets their needs, while contributors can engage with the project in an organized and productive manner.
