# Definition of Done

A task, issue or contribution is considered _done_ when:

1. All knwon edge cases, regressions or limitations are addressed  - or documented if unresolvable.
2. The code follows naming conventions and project standards.
3. The solution has been tested locally and works as intended.
4. Documentation changes and additions are included in the PR.
5. Necessary migrations, if any, are included in the PR.
6. There is no leftover commented-out code, print statements, or temporary work artifacts.
7. Non-trivial code portions include meaningful comments explaining its purpose and reasoning.

Use this as a checklist before stating that your contribution is complete.
