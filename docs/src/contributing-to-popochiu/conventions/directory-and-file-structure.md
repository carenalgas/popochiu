# Directory and file structure

## Repository's root folder

The project repository contains everything needed to develop, document, and release the plugin.  
As is standard for Godot addons, the actual code is located in the `addons` folder. Additional directories in the project root are used for documentation, automation, and a Godot project, which is automatically created in the `game` folder as soon as the plugin is enabled.

Below is the directory structure of the main [Popochiu repository](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu):  

```text
<Project Root>
├── .github                                 <-- Holds GitHub-related stuff, such as issue templates
|                                               and workflows actions.
|
├── addons
│   └── popochiu                            <-- The Popochiu Plugin and Engine reside here.
|                                               This is the part distributed in releases.
|
├── builds                                  <-- Used by release automation; should remain empty.
|
├── docs                                    <-- Contains the source for the documentation you are reading.
│   ├── dist                                <------ Used by release automation; you can ignore this.
│   ├── scripts                             <------ Holds scripts related to release automation.
│   └── src                                 <------ The main documentation source folder,
|       |                                           organized into subdirectories for each section.
│       ├── assets                          <---------- A special folder for public assets like
|       |                                                images, CSS files, and other resources.
|       └── < ... content folders ... >
├── game                                    <-- Automatically created when the plugin is enabled;
|                                               contains a functional Popochiu game. Not versioned.
└── release-notes                           <-- Contains text files with release notes, used during
                                                the release process.
```

In the root directory, you’ll also find the following notable files:

```text
home_banner.png  
icon.svg  
LEEME.md  
LICENSE  
popochiu.ico  
README.md  
```

These files are related to the project's README (available in Spanish as well) and general branding. Additionally, there’s the `project.godot` file, which is distributed with the plugin but generally should not be included in PRs unless under very specific circumstances.

You’ll also find the project’s `.gitignore` file. It’s fairly standard, excluding Godot-generated import files, common editor junk, and some files generated by release automations. It’s a good idea to review it and understand what’s excluded from the project before moving forward.

## Popochiu Addon folder

We won’t delve too deeply into the plugin's content here (refer to the [Project Overview](../project-overview) section for more details), but the `addons` folder is organized as follows:
