## How to contact maintainers

You can contact the maintainers by:

* Mentioning them in an issue or a PR on GitHub
* Reaching out on the [Carenalgas Discord server](https://discord.gg/WCnW2yAN), preferably in the `#troubleshooting` or `#contributions` channels

We can publicly discuss contributions on these channels so that the community can get involved.

For specific issues, contacting us on Discord is the quickest and most reliable option.
