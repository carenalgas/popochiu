Everything you need to start creating your adventure game with Popochiu, beside the addon, is a good idea, assets and the game script.

When working on a new project, Popochiu will set the project up for you but other than that, it will provide you with a blank slate so that you don't need to clean the stage from unwanted stuff.

If you are testing or learning the engine, or if you suffer from blank canvas syndrome, don't worry. We've got you covered!

## Example game

TODO

* Explain a game repository is available (which version?)
* Provide a link to the repository and brief instructions on how to use it

## Example assets

TODO

* Explain a set of assets (same ones used in the Example game) is available
* Provide a link to a zip file
