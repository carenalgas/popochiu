This page will guide you through the process of creating a very small stub for a game.

The purpose of this page is to quickly get you set up to experiment and tinker as you read this documentation. If you are already familiar with Popochiu or have already created your project, you can skip to the [Tutorials](/getting-started/tutorials) section.

## Example resources

If you are experimenting with Popochiu for the first time, or still evaluating if it's for you, you can speed up the following step, downloading the [Example Game Assets](/getting-started/example-resources#example-assets).

If you prefer to skip the steps and jump to the meat of the learning, you can just clone the [Example Game](#). It's a project containing the game setup and assets, plus a working version of Popochiu.

If you want to learn the basics of setting up your very project, follow along.
