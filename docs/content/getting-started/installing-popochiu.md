!!! tip
      Popochiu works on Godot 3.3 and later versions, but we recommend kickstarting new projects on Godot 4, with Popochiu 2.0.

## Get Godot

1. Download the latest version of the engine [here](https://godotengine.org/download).
2. Extract the Godot executable file (`.exe` on Windows) and place it in a directory of your choice.
3. Run the Godot executable.
4. Create a new project by clicking the `New project` button.
5. Give it a name and then click on `Create folder`.
6. Click on `Create and Edit` to launch the editor.

## Get Popochiu

### From the asset store

> TODO: Complete this

### From Itch

1. Download **Popochiu** from its [itch.io page](https://mapedorr.itch.io/popochiu)
2. Unzip the file and copy the **addons** folder into your project's folder.
   > If you don't know where your project is, right-click the `res://` folder in the **FileSystem** dock and then select `Open in File Manager`.
3. Enable the plugin in the **Project > Project Settings** menu, **Plugins** tab (at the top). Click on the **Enable** checkbox.
4. A popup will ask you to restart Godot. Close the **Project Settings** window and then `Project > Reload Current Project`.

### From GitHub

1. Download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/releases).
2. Unzip the file and copy the **addons** folder into your project's folder.
   > If you don't know where your project is, right-click the `res://` folder in the `FileSystem` dock and then select `Open in File Manager`.
3. Enable the plugin: `Project > Project Settings... > Plugins` (the tab on the top). Click on the `Enable` checkbox.
4. A popup will ask you to restart Godot. Close the **Project Settings** window and then `Project > Reload Current Project`.


If you installed Popochiu properly, you'll see the Main Dock at the right, and this message in the **Output** panel.
