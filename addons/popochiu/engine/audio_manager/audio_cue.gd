## Used to play audio files with extra properties.

## You can set the pitch (with random values), volume, and audio bus, as well as specify whether
## it loops, and whether it is 2D positioned.


## The audio file to play.
@export var audio: AudioStream
## Whether the audio file will loop when played.
@export var loop := false : set = set_loop
## Whether this audio cue uses a 2D position.
@export var is_2d := false
## Whether the audio can be played simultaneously with other instances of itself. Especially useful
## for audio cues set in a loop (where [member loop] is [code]true[/code]).
@export var can_play_simultaneous := true
## The pitch value (in semitones) to use when playing the audio file.
@export var pitch := 1.0
## The volume to use when playing the audio file.
@export var volume := 0.0
## The range of values to use for randomly changing the pitch of the audio file when played.
@export var rnd_pitch := Vector2.ZERO
## The range of values to use to randomly changing the volume of the audio file when played.
@export var rnd_volume := Vector2.ZERO
## Maximum distance from which the audio file is still hearable. This only works if [member is_2d]
## is [code]true[/code].
@export var max_distance := 2000
## The audio bus in which the audio file will be played.
@export var bus := "Master"
