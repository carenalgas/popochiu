# About

This tool consists of two parts: the core (Popochiu) and the dock that helps with the creation of the Nodes that make use of that core. It is inspired in how graphic adventure games are created in Adventure Game Studio and Power Hoof's Unity plugin: Power Quest. This is, using Rooms as the scenes where Characters can move and interact with Props and Hotspots, and providing an Inventory system and Dialog trees.
