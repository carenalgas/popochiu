# About

This tool consists of two parts: the core (Popochiu) and the dock that helps with the creation of the Nodes that make use of that core. It is inspired in how graphic adventure games are created in Adventure Game Studio and Power Hoof's Unity plugin: Power Quest. This is, using Rooms as the scenes where Characters can move and interact with Props and Hotspots, and providing an Inventory system and Dialog trees.


# Installation

**Popochiu works on Godot 3.3.x and 3.4.x.**

1. [Download the ZIP](https://github.com/mapedorr/popochiu/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract it and copy the `addons` folder into your project folder.
3. Open your Godot project and enable the Popochiu plugin: `Project > Project Settings... > Plugins` (the tab on the top).
4. Restart Godot `Project > Reload Current Project`.
5. You'll see the Popochiu dock at the right. That's all!
