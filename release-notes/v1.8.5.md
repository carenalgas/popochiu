# Popochiu v1.8.5 - Mejorandiu

This is just a test release of the latest version of the plugin (which was already released in the main repo).

# Fixes

- Loading saved games is working when the file doesn't has data for the main types: characters, inventory items or dialogs.
- Creating dialogue lines (for `E.run([])`) with wrong character names doesn't break the game.
- Creating dialogue lines with empty emotions doesn't break the game.
- **DialogText**'s ContinueIcon now is set to `modulate.a = 0.0` instead of 0.5 (this was for testing purpouses).
- **DialogText** animation speeds were not working because the method to count the total number of characters in the line was returning 0.
- Cursor doesn't show the clock icon when a **PopochiuDialog** is active.

# New things

- Added properties `times_clicked` and `times_right_clicked` to PopochiuClickable.
- Added methods `disable_input()` and `enable_input()` to PopochiuClickable.
- Created class for PopochiuDialogOption.
