# Popochiu v2.0.0 - Beta 2

This update has UX improvements and bug fixes.

## Fixes

- [Character InteractionPolygon is reset when reloading Aseprite file or running game](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/158).
- [Cursor loses its texture when leaving the inventory](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/159).
- [Portrait mode for dialog lines is not working](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/160).
- [Engine crashes when changing the focus of the window](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/162).
- [Can't block interactions](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/166).
- [The screen blinks before moving to another room](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/168).
- [Hover text and Cursor are wrong after interaction](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/170).
- [Release pipeline is broken](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/173).
- Popochiu shows the process of copying the GUI template when loaded for the first time.

## New features

- Now players can cancel an interaction when `C.walk_to_clicked()` or `C.CharacterScriptName.walk_to_clicked` is called. `C.walk_to_clicked_blocking()` and `C.CharacterScriptName.walk_to_clicked_blocking()` were created to block the GUI and prevent players to cancel such interactions.
- Now devs don't have to manually restart the enging after enabling the plugin for the first time. Popochiu restarts Godot for them after closing the popup or clicking OK.
- (Internal) Thanks to @stickgrinder now the release process + documentation generation will be as easy as publishing the tag of the release and the file with the release notes.
- Popochiu clears the Hover text and changes the Cursor to its "normal" shape when changing room.



## Others

- Completed documentation for (almost) all Engine classes (except for the GUI components and popups). You can check the list of already documented classes [here](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/133).
- 9 Verb GUI cursor doesn't use the "active" animation anymore.
