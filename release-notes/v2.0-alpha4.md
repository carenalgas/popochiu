# Popochiu 2.0 Alpha 4
[![Godot v4.0.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-4.0.x-blue)](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.0.4-stable/) [![Godot v4.1.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-4.1.x-blue)](https://godotengine.org/download)

## New features

- Added is_pixel_art_game property to ProjectSettings. When selecting Pixel in Game type (setup popup) the default texture filter is set to TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST for props, characters and inventory items.
- [NPC's follows the player](https://github.com/mapedorr/popochiu/pull/105) when the `follow_player` property is `true`.
- Add `v_frames`` property to PopochiuProp.
- Add settings option to set a pixel perfect game. When `true`, the cursor moves in whole pixels (thanks to @Whyshchuck ).
- The cursor sprite doesn't leave the viewport when the mouse pointer leaves the game window.

## Fixes

- [Audio Cues: Checking "loop" renders sound silent](https://github.com/mapedorr/popochiu/issues/87)
- Setting an inventory item as active with add_as_active makes the cursor take the appearance of the item.
- Devs can select items to start with in the Main tab.
